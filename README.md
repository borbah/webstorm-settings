# Dark Material UI custom webstorm-settings

Here's my config for Webstorm IDE with some color tweaks (i didn't like the default one so much). 

### How to install?
1. Simply download settings.jar, 
2. Go to **File -> Import Settings** and choose downloaded file 
3. After a while app will ask you to update plugin Material UI
4. Restart app, and voila!
